# Outline Completed!

#An organization like SSN College of Engineering wants to develop a mentoring system. 
#A mentor should be able to view all the mentees assigned to them. 
#On selecting a mentee, the mentor should be able to add/delete/update the mentee details. 
#The mentor may schedule a meeting with a mentee and should be able to capture the meeting details later. 
#A mentee should be able to see only their details, except for the confidential information
entered by the mentor. 
#A mentee should be able to request for a meeting with the mentor through this
system. 
#The manager should be able to generate various reports from these mentee records.
